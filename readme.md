## Synopsis

It's a **"Kanban board"** single page web application. You can add new tasks, edit, start doing, finish and cancel them. The board condition saves for a user even after the page refresh.

## Motivation

This is a test job for one of companies. I liked it and it was interesting for me to do it, because it's like a new challenge for me.
